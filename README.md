## About The Project

There are many bounding box annnotation softwares, but nearly every one of them accepts only the text data i.e. label of the bounding box. But for computer vision tasks, you'll need a bit more, like column and row indexes of each item. And for cuneiform tablets, you'll need the language data for post processing the data. Since, there is no website that satisfies my demands, I created my own!

Here are the most significant features:
- You can sign up as either *Moderator* or *Student*. Moderators assign the tablets to Students to keep the sensitive data secure. If you are not assigned to a Tablet, you can not see any of it's features, besides a small thumbnail on the main page.
- The bounding box not only accepts the text input (which is not pre-defined, you can write anything you want), it also gets the following data: Language, Row Index, Column Index.
- The annotation page contains a toolbar where annotated elements are organized by row value, making it as intuitive to navigate as reading a book!

PS: You can only upload .jpg or .JPEG file formats. Although it is modifiable through backend.
